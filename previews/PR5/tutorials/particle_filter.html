states given noisy and partial observations of the state of a hidden Markov model by a cloud of <code>K</code> weighted particles with weights <code>W</code>.</p><p>In this tutorial, we are going to:</p><ul><li>implement a differentiable particle filter based on <code>StochasticAD.jl</code>.</li><li>visualize the particle filter in <span>$d = 2$</span> dimensions.</li><li>compare the gradient based on the differentiable particle filter to a biased gradient estimator as well as to the gradient of a differentiable Kalman filter.</li><li>show how to benchmark primal evaluation, forward- and reverse-mode AD of the particle filter.</li></ul><h2 id="Setup"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Setup">Setup</a><a id="Setup-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Setup" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>We will make use of several julia packages. For example, we are going to use <code>Distributions</code> and <code>DistributionsAD</code> that implement the reparameterization trick for Gaussian distributions used in the observation and state-transition model, which we specify below. We also import <code>GaussianDistributions.jl</code> to implement the differentiable Kalman filter.</p><h3 id="Package-dependencies"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Package-dependencies">Package dependencies</a><a id="Package-dependencies-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Package-dependencies" title="Permalink"></a></h3><pre><code class="language-julia hljs"># activate tutorial project file

For current state <code>x</code> and parameters <code>θ</code>, <code>xnew = rand(dyn(x, θ))</code> samples the new state (i.e. <code>dyn</code> gives for each <code>x, θ</code> a distribution-like object).
